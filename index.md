## ASSIGNMENT

In this assignment, the main purpose is to make an explanatory data analysis by using the Airbnb dataset which has neighbourhood/neighbourhood_group, price, room_type etc.

To be able to reach the analysis of this data, you can click on this [html link](https://pjournal.github.io/boun01g-data-mine-r-s/Assignment/Airbnb.html) or this [pdf link](https://pjournal.github.io/boun01g-data-mine-r-s/Assignment/Airbnb.pdf)

Furthermore, you can reach interactive analysis of the data by using our [shiny app](https://pjournal.github.io/boun01g-data-mine-r-s/Assignment/Airbnb_Shiny.html)

If you want to make your own analysis, you can download and get information about the Airbnb data from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data) page
